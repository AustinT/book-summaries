# Seeing like a State

## James C. Scott

Through a series of stories and case studies, this book describes ways that
states try to change people in them to make them more "legible", and describes
how this often fails. The philosophy of "high modernism" is often invoked by
these states, and the book largely serves as a case against high modernism.

Some scenarios that stood out to me:

- The following things are basically inventions of the state to make extracting
  tax/soldiers easier:
    - Standardized weights/measures
    - Property ownership records (makes it clear who is responsible for paying
      the tax)
    - Surnames (helps identify individuals)
- *Scientific forestry* trying to maximize the wood from a forest by planting
  dense grids of the tree with the best wood. It worked very well at first, but
  a mixture of soil nutrient depletion and pest invasions significantly reduced
  the long-term yield.
- *City planners* like Le Corbusier tried to make "orderly" cities with regular
  grids, wide roads, and organized work/residential/commercial districts. A few
  were built (eg Brasilia, Brazil and Chandigarh, India). However, people
  mostly hated these cities: the public places were not particularly nice to
  "hang out" in, and many aspects of life were left out of planning (eg things
  that weren't commuting to/from work, like "going for a family walk").
- *Scientific agriculture* promoted mono-cropping and mechanization, which
  didn't work well in many regions (same problems as forestry), and disregarded
  other factors (eg stability of yield, peasants using parts of the plants to
  do other things like make clothing, mixed crops being able to deter pests,
  etc)
- *Standardizing measurements* does not always work as intended. You can always
  measure land by area, but if you want to use this measurement to estimate
  something like crop yields, area may not always work well, since
  rainfall/soil/topography can vary a lot. Local measurements are sometimes
  things like "how much food does the land produce" rather than its footprint.
- Some African governments (particularly Tanzania) tried to re-settle their
  rural/nomadic populations into standard, government-constructed villages.
  These villages tended to fail spectacularly or be wholly unsuitable for the
  rural residence (eg, very far away from their farms).

The most interesting idea of the book was, to me, that states might not stop at
_recording_ reality to make it legible, but to change reality to make it more
legible (eg collecting farms into villages, forcing people to abandon practices
like shared land ownership). It is from here that the book moves into a
prolonged critique of central planning and "high modernism". Although stories
from these critiques are interesting, it feels like the book has cherry-picked
cases where things worked out badly and ignored ones where it worked well. For
example, segmenting the UK into post codes means that anybody can get reliable
deliveries: something I benefit from regularly.

To be fair, Scott explicitly _does not_ claim that he thinks planning is bad.
In one of the later chapters, he summarized the message saying something like
"Planners assume they are smarter than they really are, and that people they
are planning for are dumber than they really are." I think this is a fair
message, but wouldn't extrapolate this to "default to not planning", since
there are many times when planning is good.

Overall, my feelings seem similar to those conveyed by [Scott Alexander in his
review](https://slatestarcodex.com/2017/03/16/book-review-seeing-like-a-state/).

Finally, this was the first book I ever listened to as an audio book. I'm not
sure what to make of the experience: I enjoyed the convenience, but found it
difficult to pay as close attention to the book as when I normally read print
books.
