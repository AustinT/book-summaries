This book tries to answer the question "why some human societies developed
differently than others" (for example, ancient China vs ancient Australia, or
medieval Europe vs medieval North America). Roughly, it proposes that the
differences in these societies can be largely explained by environmental
factors rather than cultural factors, such as the availability of domesticable
plants/animals. I think it made a very convincing case. It also had a wealth of
information about how early humans expanded, with a special focus on Polynesia,
which I found very interesting.

Overall this is a book that I'd highly recommend!
