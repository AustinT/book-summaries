# The Years of Lyndon Johnson

By Robert Caro

This is actually a 4 book series, with a fifth book hopefully coming out in the
next few years. Overall it was ~3000 pages. I listed to it on audiobook during
runs and commuting for ~6 months.

**Why did I read this?** I started this book because I saw some discourse
online that it was the _best biography ever_. I had hardly read any biographies
before so I thought "why not start with the best"?

**What's in the books?** Unsurprisingly, they are mostly a description of his
life, in chronological order. My recollection is:

- He's born in a small town in Texas and grows up in a semi-wealthy family
  which then loses its wealth when he is a teenager.
- He goes to teacher's college (it's the only thing he can afford, and he's not
  very academic).
- He teaches in a small town near Mexico for a year, then in Houston.
- He goes to DC and becomes the secretary/assistant for a congressman.
- He then became a bureaucrat running the Texas division of the National Youth
  Administration (a new government agency during the great depression to create
  jobs for young people).
- He then ran for congress, campaigned furiously, got elected in 1937, then
  didn't do too much.
- He ran for the senate in 1948 and won, although the election may have been
  fraudulent.
- He worked his way up to become the senate majority leader.
- He was selected as JFK's vice president.
- He became president when JFK was assassinated.

However, the main value of the books is not the facts and timeline of his life,
it's understanding what kind of person LBJ was and why he was successful in
politics. What stood out to me is:

- He was in many ways a selfish and repulsive person- I actually quite disliked
  him based on Caro's descriptions.
- His biggest talent was one-on-one persuasion, getting in people's heads
  (usually with flattery) and saying exactly what they wanted to hear. Caro
  frequently calls him "a reader of men" and "a _leader_ of men".
- He was incredibly determined and focused, almost working himself to death on
  many occasions, doing _everything_ possible to win elections.
- He had no principles or policy goals, and seemed to think that being
  idealistic in politics was "naive". He basically did and said whatever would
  get him elected, and tried to avoid taking a stance on any issue.
- He was cruel to those around him. He was particularly mean to his staff and
  to his wife. He seemed to find people who wanted his approval and he used
  this to get them to work slavishly for him.
- His other political talent was finding unusual compromises, building
  coalitions to get bills passed in a remarkably effective way.

Along the way, reading this book gives an interesting glimpse into many aspects
of 20th century US history which I didn't know too much about:

- Discrimination in the US south pre-civil rights (lots of disturbing anecdotes
  like Emmett Till).
- The great depression and the new deal.
- How political power works in the US senate (seniority system, power resting
  with committee chairmen).
- What the moments and days after JFK's assassination looked like.
- How the vice president is a weirdly powerless position.
- How sponsoring politicians influences politics (basically politicians make
  deals, and apparently the name recognition effect was huge back then, and
  probably still is huge).
- How somebody with no money and no power can get sponsorship (they found a
  rich construction company owner desperate to get one of their infrastructure
  projects approved, and no other candidate would champion them).

**Overall thoughts:** Overall I think the series is good to read, but given its
length I won't uncritically recommend it. If you have the time then I think its
incredibly interesting, and I think it's the right pace / style to be consumed
in audiobook form while doing chores/exercise/etc. I will definitely get the
final book when it comes out.

On a different note, the writing itself is superb. Caro is able to take a
subject which is naturally very dry and actually make it very entertaining,
which is very impressive!
