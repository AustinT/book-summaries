# A Mathematician's Lament

## By Paul Lockhart

This is a short book which argues that mathematics should be about the process
of reasoning and understanding things, rather than memorizing formulas and
mindlessly doing exercises. It's a short book and makes a compelling case. If
you want kids to like math, it should be curiosity-driven!
