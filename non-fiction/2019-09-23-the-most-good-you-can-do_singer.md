# The Most Good You Can Do
## Peter Singer
Third Peter Singer book I read.
It essentially a summary of the effective altruism movement,
and served as a good overview of what I had read in various
blogs/websites but all in one book.
I would definitely recommend it to anybody interested in quickly
learning what effective altruism is about.

The main points I got out of the book were:
- Effective altruism means trying to do the most good altruistically,
 even if this means supporting some "good" causes less than other
 "good" causes: the goal is to support the **most** effective causes,
 since we live in a world where not all causes are being addressed.
 Good example is funding art museum versus starving children:
 clearly more good can be done feeding the children.
- You don't have to be a saint to be an effective altruist:
 giving just a modest part of your income is better than nothing.
 This is called _earning to give_.
- Altruism is mostly associated with love or compassion,
 but effective altruism is more motivated by reason,
 in the sense that the work is all guided by reason
 and the core people in the movement justify their actions
 mostly out of reason rather than emotion.
- Supporting local/domestic organizations seems like it should
 take priority over international aid, but costs of goods
 are much lower in developing countries so a donation
 is typically much more effective when directed abroad
 rather than to the poor in affluent countries
 (assuming people reading this are from affluent countries).
- Comparing different causes (women's rights, education,
 food aid, disease aid) seems impossible,
 but there are actually ways of doing it (like QALYs,
 or quality-adjusted life years),
 so you don't have to treat different causes as fundamentally
 incomparable.
- Looking at administrative costs is not a great way to choose which
 charity to donate to, as you don't know how effective the
 non-administrative money is used.
 Maybe the extra administration is worth it to get an extra effect.
 Of course less administration is better, but you can't compare
 just based on this figure alone.
- The problem with donating to large organizations that do
 many different things is that they spread your money
 out for causes of varying effectiveness.
 Probably better to just donate to something that is
 directly effective.
- Advocacy can have huge returns on investment,
 since there is much more government money than EA donation money.
- If you look at the potential returns/risks avoided,
 preventing human extinctions is a hugely beneficial charitable endeavour.
