# Marx: A Very Short Introduction
## Peter Singer
Second Peter Singer book I read.
Good substitute for reading Marx himself I reckon,
whose writings seem quite long and abstruse.
This book had a high information density which I liked.

Main points:
- Marx's writing based largely off Hegel's.
 Hegel argued for an abstract "universal mind",
 and when people fail to recognize this they fight
 other people as if they were different beings
 but in reality they are both part of the "universal mind".
 Marx said instead that economic systems alienate people from each other
 as they create division and conflict between people who are normally
 the same.
- He distinguishes _abstract labour_ (making things for money)
 from _concrete labour_ (making things that have "use-value").
 It seemed that his view was that one's labour is one's life,
 and one can either exchange it for money, or use it to produce
 things that you find valuable.
 This nicely parallels the choice many young people have to make
 between higher-paying jobs or more meaningful jobs.
- Shared a view with many contemporaries that history had a "goal"
 or "general direction", and he thought this direction was mainly
 economical in nature and would result in a proletariat revolution.
- Marx made many economical predictions, most of them completely wrong.
 He is better viewed as a philosopher about economics rather
 than an actual economist.
 His philosophical commentary was about the relationship between
 people under capitalism.
- He didn't define communism that well;
 he spent more time finding problems than proposing solutions.
 The failed communist regimes showed that what he did write
 was definitely not a complete guidebook for Utopia.
