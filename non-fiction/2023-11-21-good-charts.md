# Good Charts

## By Scott Berinato (editor at Harvard Business Review)

A book about making good charts. My few sentence summary would be:

> Unlike text which is read left to right, people don't read charts in a
> particular order: instead they focus on salient features and quickly look for
> "the point." Design charts with this in mind, rather than simply trying to
> present the data. Start with your purpose for making the chart (usually
> delivering some particular message) and make that message the most salient
> thing.  Use colour / highlighting / chart style to your advantage and remove
> clutter as much as possible (remember less is more). This will result in
> charts which help your audience "get" the message without any fuss.

**Overall:** I think the book had a lot of good points, but seems more targeted
at business people / managers rather than scientists since most of the book
talks about how to make charts which convey a particular message. I think the
ideal scientific chart should skew more towards showing the data in an
"objective" way. Nonetheless, I think the points in this book can be helpful
because like it or not, most scientists looking at your chart will also try to
find a "message".

More detailed notes:

- Data visualization is fairly recent (most within the past 100 years)
- 5 key things to understand about reading charts:
    1. There is no order to reading visuals (unlike text)
    2. We see first what stands out (e.g. trends, outliers)
    3. We see only a few things at once. Crowded charts with many trends don't show clear patterns
    4. We natural imbue meaning and connections, so viewers will see connections between things presented together
    5. We rely on conventions and metaphors (so don't deviate too much from what viewers expect, e.g. always have North pointing up)
- Good mantra: "A manager should be able to present dataset without speaking at all. If it can't speak for itself, it has failed like a joke whose punch line needs explanation" (page 67)
- Data visualizations can vary across two axes:
    - Is the information conceptual or data driven (i.e. is there actually a dataset)
    - Are the visuals declarative (trying to prove some point) or exploratory (you are trying to learn something)?
    - Chart quality/density/focus will change depending on the purpose. Conveying a particular point calls for a more streamlined chart, while exploratory data analysis can have more functional charts which look worse
- To create better charts:
    - Resist the urge to just go with the first chart you make!
    - Sketch out multiple ideas and think about which one is more effective?
    - Talk out the chart with a colleague maybe. Are the key points clear?
    - Refine the chart aggressively. Simply and remove clutter.
    - Make the most salient info clearly visible.
- Consistency is key: always include things like axis labels, etc. Even if things are obvious from context (e.g. axis labels), including everything in a chart allows it to be used in another context (e.g. copied/pasted into another presentation).
- To be persuasive:
    - Make the takeaway message the most salient feature.
    - Can add emphasize with isolation (e.g. grouping things together, using color to make one point stand out) or by adding/removing/shifting reference points. Reference points can be context (e.g. historical data, reference prices) or units (e.g. presenting in workdays vs "hours per year")
- Think about persuasion vs manipulation (it is a fine line). Some useful case studies:
    - Truncating y axes: this can sometimes be appropriate (e.g. zooming in on a trend) but can also exaggerate trends. It distorts the "areas" of different parts of a chart though, which can be misleading.
    - Double y axes: can be helpful, but also makes it easy to imply misleading comparisons with different units and phenomena like "intersecting lines" which don't actually mean anything
    - Maps: no easy solutions here. Large areas of low population (e.g. Canada) can distort perceptions.
    - A checklist for whether something is misleading rather than just persuasive:
        - Does the chart make it easier to see the idea, or does it actively change the idea?
        - If it is changing the idea, does the new idea contradict the one in the less persuasive chart?
        - Does eliminating information hide something that would rightfully challenge the idea I'm showing?
        - Would I feel deceived if somebody else presented me with a chart like this?
- Even if you have a good chart, presenting it properly is also important:
    - If giving an oral presentation, pause and let the audience look at the chart. A good chart will be somewhat self-explanatory and should not need your explanation. Plus, people find it hard to focus on you speaking while also looking at a chart.
    - Only explain the chart format if it is unusual.
    - Using "reference" charts can help (e.g. this is what consistent growth would look like)
    - If you want to make a clear/bold point, consider turning off your presentation. The audience will immediately focus on you.
    - To make the audience engaged, reveal parts of the chart gradually. This also makes it easier for them to get your message. An example of this is the "zooming out" graphic to represent sizes of things on hugely different scales.
- Good writers are good readers! Practice critiquing other people's charts to make better charts yourself.
- The book had a nice closing line: "You are here, at the end, which means you've started. Now keep going."
