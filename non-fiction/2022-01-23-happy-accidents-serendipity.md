# Happy Accidents: Serendipity in Modern Medical Breakthroughs

## Morton A Meyers

This book tells a series of stories about the discovery of many important
medical technologies: antibiotics, antidepressants, the cause of stomach
ulcers, and chemotherapy to name a few. The underlying theme is that many of
this discoveries happened _serendipitously_: not randomly or by dumb luck, but
stemming from an "unexpected observation seized upon and turned to advantage by
the prepared mind." The book had some interesting points about the practice of
research.

- In academic papers, researchers tend to "cover their tracks" and present
  a false narrative of how the discovery was made, typically that it came
  naturally by following a set of premises to their logical conclusion. You may
  even call this "retrospective falsification".
- It is easy for scientists to get distracted by short term goals (e.g. cure
  disease X), and mentally ignore the implications that their discoveries might
  have in other fields (e.g. a poor cure for X might be a good cure for Y)
- A surprising number of discoveries that receive prestigious awards are
  accompanied by a controversy of who gets credit. These disputes seem messy,
  so its probably best to work with people who are eager to share credit.
- Good quote from Claude Bernard: "If an idea presents itself to us, we must
  not reject it simply because it does not agree with the logical deductions of
  a reigning theory". Seems obvious, but in practice people do this a lot.
  I guess theories that are too powerful can mentally "trap" people.
- Big, heavily directed funding efforts can fail spectacularly: for example,
  the US had a "war on cancer" starting in the 70s, which initially was not
  very successful because the paradigm they were operating in was not quite
  right (details were not super clear). I think the general lesson is that
  centralization means you bet everything on one approach, which can fail if
  the approach is wrong.
- Grant-based funding does not promote serendipity: in fact, it can discourage
  it if you are penalized for not achieving pre-set goals.
- Peer review heavily promotes orthodoxy: so many landmark papers are rejected
  just because they imply that the scientific consensus might not be right!
- Education seems to promote learning "facts" over "processes of reasoning"
  (especially medical education). This yields a poor foundation for making
  discoveries.
- It would be nice if serendipitous discoveries were admitted more directly in
  journals.

For me personally, I found the book quite useful, even though the research
domain is different from my own. I will try to allow for more serendipity!
