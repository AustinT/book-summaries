# The Elephant in the Brain: Hidden Motives in Everyday Life

## Kevin Simler and Robin Hanson

This book suggests that many actions in everyday life have hidden, often
selfish motives which are both not openly acknowledged and usually not
explicitly recognized. The book is split into 2 parts: one explaining why we
might have hidden motives, and a second part exploring various aspects of life
where they suggest surprising hidden motives lie.

The case they make for hidden motives is fairly simple. Nature is full of
competition, and although collectively humans "in the wild" can achieve more by
cooperation than competition, individually it is better to cheat and act
competitively while everybody else acts cooperatively (for example, you keep
your gathered food while everybody else shares it communally). To get around
this, societies have tended to form strong norms against overtly selfish
actions, typically enforced as a community (for example being ostracized from
the group for continually taking more than your share). In practice enforcement
isn't perfect, so people who want to cheat the norms need to do so subtly and
secretly. However, as people are generally quite bad at lying, we've evolved to
sort of believe our own lies or simply not acknowledge the true reasons for
doing things, as this makes it easier to plausibly deny cheating if directly
confronted. Therefore we have a strong social incentive to not acknowledge or
be aware of hidden selfish motives for our actions. I found this quite
plausible.

In the second part they go over a list of scenarios with alleged hidden motives:

- *Body language.* While typically not noticed consciously, body language is
  used to communicate sex and social status.
- *Laughter.* While we typically think of laughter as a reaction to something
  funny, this doesn't match observations that people laugh more when talking vs
  listening, or in social situations (e.g. at comedy show vs watching
  a comedian on TV). They suggest that laughter is actually an overt "play"
  signal to show benign intentions in situations that might otherwise be
  ambiguous.
- *Conversation.* Less of an exchange of information and more of a tool to gain
  mates and allies. This explains why most people would rather talk than
  listen.
- *Consumption.* We think that we consume things for ourselves, but a lot of it
  is to signal intelligence, loyalty, or status to others. This is how a lot of
  advertising works: for example ads for alcohol and perfumes which show
  a lifestyle rather than the product make people buy things for consumption in
  front of others when they want to convey a certain message. These ads work by
  convincing us that this is how other people perceive a certain product, even
  if you (the buyer) aren't explicitly convinced.
- *Art.* They say art is mostly for showing off by doing evolutionarily
  "useless" things, because it signals that you are fit enough to have surplus
  time and energy to pursue unnecessary things.
- *Charity.* Most people donate to feel good or look good rather than to
  actually help the cause. One piece of evidence for this is that people tend
  to hardly do any research when considering donating to a charity.
- *Education.* Mostly a tool for social signalling and sorting people rather
  than actually learning. Consider that most people forget almost everything
  that they learn in school, and employers who want people with degrees don't
  seem to care how much of your degree you remember. Instead, doing well in
  school shows that you can follow instructions and learn abstruse concepts on
  demand, which people generally find valuable. Of course, it isn't all
  signalling (doctors and engineers definitely come out with more knowledge for
  example), but they just claim it is more signalling than we like to admit.
- *Medicine*. They claim that a lot of medicine is about the appearance of
  putting in a great amount of effort to care for people, as evidenced that
  people's consumption of medical services doesn't seem to closely relate to
  the health value of these services. Of course, this is masked largely by the
  actual healing that does go on it medicine. Overall I found this chapter's
  evidence quite weak.
- *Religion.* They claim it is mostly an exercise of signalling loyalty to your
  in-group by doing silly things that you wouldn't otherwise do, since it is
  only difficult things that make reliable signals. I thought this chapter was
  quite insightful.
- *Politics.* They say it is mostly about signalling loyalty, which makes
  sense.

Overall this book was interesting to read, although I think that reading
a summary would be sufficient for most people.
