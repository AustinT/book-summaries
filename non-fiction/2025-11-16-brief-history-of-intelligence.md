Interesting short book describing the evolution of the human brain as a series
of "breakthroughs":

1. Navigation: in worm-like animals, they learned to steer left and right, and
   move forward or stay put. Their brains differentiate between "good" and
   "bad" stimuli.
2. Reinforcement: in fish-like animals (early vertebrates), they learned to
   repeat good behaviours and avoid bad behaviours from trial-and-error
   learning.
3. Simulating: in early mammals they were able to "imagine" possible outcomes
   and learn from that (eg if I go in the open field maybe a bird will eat me).
4. Mentalizing: primates learned to simulate the minds of others to some
   degree. Allows skills to be taught.
5. Language: humans learned to communicate abstract ideas through language.

Along the way lots of analogies to AI are made. Overall nice book, I highly
recommend!
