# Born to Run

## Christopher McDougall

This book is a long work of investigative journalism in which the author tracks
down members of the Tarahumara Native Mexican tribe known for their
long-distance running ability and participates in a race between some famous
Tarahumara runners and some American ultra-marathoners. The narrative is
interweaved with arguments about why humans are naturally suited for endurance
running, and advocacy for barefoot running.

I read this book primarily looking for guidance on running, but there was
actually very little specific guidance (essentially avoid padded shoes).
Therefore this was not my favourite book, although it was interesting and
somewhat inspiring to read about ultra-marathoners.
