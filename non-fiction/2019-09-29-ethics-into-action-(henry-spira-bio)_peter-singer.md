# Ethics Into Action
## Peter Singer
Essentially a biography of Henry Spira (an influential animal rights activist in the US),
who got a lot of tangible victories for the cause of animal rights without having a huge
organization backing him, or even that much funding.
It was a good read, but the main takeaway was the lessons at the back of the book
about how to be an effective activist:
1. **Understand how the public thinks**:
 many people get radicalized by other activists. You must be aware of the ordinary
 person's position and how you might work to change it.
2. **Select target where public opinion is on your side, and there is an opportunity to achieve change**:
 You know you have a good target when just by saying what you want to change,
 the people supporting it get defensive.
3. **Set achievable goals: not just raising awareness**.
 Many groups just _raise awareness_ without a plan
 of how that will lead to their goals being accomplished.
 It's as if enough people will be aware,
 and then the whole system will topple down.
 You should be willing to settle:
 it's impractical to ask for "total victory or nothing".
4. **Establish credible sources**: if your organization
 is careful about being credible, it will make people
 believe you in the long run (for example journalists).
 Don't sacrifice credibility or people will think you exaggerate issues.
 Often times the details are in the public domain (such as investor reports,
 media releases, or white papers).
5. **Don't divide the world into "saints and sinners"**:
 many activists just act like they are good and others are bad,
 and just need to be good. While it may be true to a degree,
 it isn't a helpful attitude to have to actually change people's behaviour.
6. **Seek dialogue and attempt to work together. Treat issues as problems with solutions**:
 The people you are trying to change maybe never thought about your issue,
 and might be able/willing to work with you. This is much easier than fighting them.
 They will also be more willing to act if you can propose a reasonable solution to them.
7. **Prepare for confrontation via public awareness campaign**:
 if you can't work with them, be ready to increase the pressure with an effective campaign.
8. **Avoid bureaucracy**:
 Bureaucracy in your organization just ends up wasting time.
 If you need coordination, you can make an ad-hoc coalition.
9. **Don't assume only legislation can solve your problem**:
 Lawmakers have enough to do. You can probably be more effective
 by using other means.
10. **Ask yourself if it will work**:
 if you can't picture a realistic narrative of your campaign working,
 you need to change your plans.
