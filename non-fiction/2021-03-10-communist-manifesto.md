# The Communist Manifesto

## Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels

It was very interesting to read the original communist manifesto. It was a lot
shorter than I expected, and much of it was devoted to Marxist history and
explaining which political factions they agreed/disagreed with. Remarkably
little was actually said about communism. That being said it was still
interesting to read.
