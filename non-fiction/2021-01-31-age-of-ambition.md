# Age of Ambition: Chasing Fortune, Truth, and Faith in the New China

## Evan Osnos

This book is an eclectic mixture of stories from the 2000s in China: a period
of great change and progress in the country, with a generally critical
attitude. Reading this book gave me a better feeling of what it was like to be
a young Chinese person in that era, although it's hard to attribute this to any
particular part of the book. I think the stories are best understood as
a collection rather than a set of individual stories.

Some takeaways:

- The philosophy of "cramming in as much as possible" on a tour to Europe
  seemed to explain a lot of the behaviour that I've seen from Chinese tour
  groups.
- Censorship in China is like "an anaconda in the chandelier": its presence is
  known, and it feels no need to be explicit about the rules. It silently says
  "you decide by yourself" and people quite naturally make adjustments
  accordingly (paraphrased from the book).
- The government works quite hard to silence dissidents, even if they make
  quite reasonable claims (e.g. Ai Weiwei and the Sichuan earthquake disaster).
  The government really values stability and doesn't want to admit that it made
  a mistake.
- Corruption in China is quite systemic and probably almost impossible to get
  rid of completely.
- Lots of Chinese people, especially young people, don't fully accept
  government propaganda and are quite independent thinkers: they just try not
  to be too vocal about it and be left alone.

Overall I recommend reading this book if you want to understand China more,
although with the rise of WeChat and other Chinese technology platforms the
book's view of Chinese society is probably already a bit dated, since this has
changed daily life a huge amount, and also the way that censorship is
conducted.
