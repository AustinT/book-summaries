# Practical Ethics
## Peter Singer

A very interesting book that summarizes Singer's view on a variety of
controversial topics relevant to today's society.
Without going into the arguments, here are the points the book makes:
1. Ethics is about a _universalizable_ justification of actions.
2. Affirmative action can still be considered equal,
 without opening the doors to racism and sexism.
3. Animals have some moral weight (_not necessarily
 the same as people_), and must be considered in ethical decisions.
4. Killing of sentient/self-aware beings is more wrong than
 "merely conscious" beings. It is difficult to defend the principle
 that human life is "uniquely and innately valuable",
 which is the origin of many people's view on killing.
5. We should reconsider our treatment of animals,
 in particular factory farming is unnecessarily cruel.
6. Abortion should be allowed since the fetus is not a full person
7. Euthanasia should be allowed, especially voluntary euthanasia,
 as the arguments against killing are weakened when a person wants
 to die or their life has more suffering than pleasure.
8. We should give more money to end extreme poverty.
9. We all have a responsibility for climate change
 (we = people in affluent countries with high emissions).
10. We have an ethical responsibility to protect the environment.
11. Civil disobedience is hard to justify,
 but essentially makes sense if you minimize harm
 and "really believe you are right",
 since there is no objective way to compare your values
 with society's values.
12. Why should we be ethical? It is difficult/impossible
 to argue that being ethical follows purely from reason,
 so his reason is essentially "to reach a deep happiness".

## Interesting arguments
These are arguments which I found interesting and provocative.

### Affirmative action is not necessarily unequal
A sound basis of equality is _equality of interests_,
meaning that all people's interests should be weighted
equally, even if the people themselves are not equal
in many respects.
Racial equality follows because people of different
races have the same interests.

Affirmative action is indeed a form of discrimination,
but then again so are university admissions processes in
general, since they select for intelligent people.
Just as one doesn't choose their race, one doesn't choose
their intelligence, and therefore both practices
can be viewed as discrimination.

But discrimination based on intelligence seems to be justified
based on the relevance of intelligence to the field of study:
for example, admitting more intelligent students into medical
school should produce more skilled doctors who are more likely
to pass their courses.
As rational as this seems it is a somewhat arbitrary goal
set by the university; the university could instead
select for social and empathetic doctors who can work
better with patients, even if they are slightly less
skilled medically.
In reality the university selects for a variety of goals,
and racial equality can be one of these goals,
as admitting doctors of different races can create role
models for minorities, and minority doctors might relate
better with minority patients.

You can disagree with exactly how effective this mechanism
is, and whether this goal is worth pursuing in this way,
but if you accept that all people are equal
then selecting for intelligence is similar to accepting
based on race in that both are a discriminatory procedure
with some justification in that it achieves a goal.

### The suffering of animals is ethically relevant
Consider the opposite argument (which our society seems to follow).
Two approaches for arguing that animal suffering is
_ethically irrelevant_ are:
1. *Deontological*: animals simply have no moral value,
 and therefore actions against them are not wrong.
2. *Consequentialist*: animals are not as
 sentient/self-aware/capable of pleasure and pain as
 humans are, and therefore the consequences of
 animal suffering are substantially reduced,
 possibly even negligible.

Point 1 can be considered _speciesist_,
(discrimination based on species membership).
The book argues that while this may seem intuitively ok,
speciesism is very similar to racism or sexism,
which simply presupposes that ethics only includes one group.
If you simply accept an ethics which includes humans and
excludes non-humans,
on what basis could you differentiate that from an ethics
that includes white humans and excludes non-white humans?
Many philosophers have put effort into creating fundamental rules
(such as self-awareness) that neatly separate humans and animals
and thereby justify speciesism, however these rules almost
always fail at edge cases (for example some severely retarded people
might not be self-aware, and these ethics would thereby exclude them).
So from a deontological perspective it is difficult to advocate speciesism
without strong parallels to racism/sexism/classism.

Point 2 typically fails when you examine the properties of animals further.
For example, many animals are not sentient by most definitions,
but some animals have a high degree of sentience (at least comparable
to small children or the mentally retarded).
Some animals (like mussels) effectively feel no pain,
while other animals definitely do.
So while animals may be given a lesser weighting by many metrics,
the weighting is certainly not zero,
and therefore is not negligible.

I don't think the book advocates for complete equality of animals
and humans, just that animals should have some ethical weight,
and definitely more than they are given in the current climate of
factory farming.

### Abortion and Potential People
An interesting argument against abortion is made following the previous arguments.
Firstly, the previous arguments on animal rights reject the idea
that human life is inherently valuable; at least no more valuable
than many other types of life.
The value of a fetus must then come from other properties
(such as sentience, self-awareness, capacity to feel pleasure/pain),
which the fetus doesn't have (at least not more than many animals).
Therefore the intrinsic moral value of killing a fetus is similar to killing an animal.

There is then a discussion of whether abortion is wrong because it kills a _potential_
person, which I do think is a compelling argument.
However, the book dives into the issue of potential people a lot
(_and I didn't think I fully understood or internalized the argument_),
and essentially claims that accepting crimes against potential people leads
to many other more questionable claims.
- If potential people are _ethically replaceable_
 (meaning you could abort the child if you had another one after
 to replace the lost life),
 then aborting a fetus is no different than using a condom
 and preventing the conception of a child in the first place:
 in both cases a child who would likely have existed will now no longer exist.
- If potential people are _ethically irreplaceable_,
 then this leads to a strange view of the future where we have no specific
 set of obligations to future generations.
 For example, we could collectively not do anything about climate change,
 and make life worse for future generations,
 but argue that if we had done something, people's lives would have
 changed and many couples would never have met, meaning that almost
 everybody alive in the future owes their specific irreplaceable
 lives to the exact set of events that led to their conception.

Abortion's ethical and legal status could potentially be different,
but the book advocates that abortion is not particularly unethical,
and also consequentially not that different than killing a newborn
(since birth is not a clean ethical dividing line for killing).
But Peter Singer accepts this, arguing that indeed killing
a newborn is not much different ethically than a late-term
abortion.
Nonetheless he still thinks infanticide should be _illegal_.

### Consequentialism doesn't distinguish between doing and not doing
Many people view morality as a set of _negative rules_
(things to not do) instead of specifying things that you should do.
Therefore stealing food from a homeless person would be wrong,
but not giving them food would be ok.
Yet from a consequentialist standpoint the result of both is the same:
the homeless person doesn't have food.

It may also seem to place a huge moral burden on many people to be responsible
for omissions, since people make large omissions every day (like not donating
to global poverty).
However, that doesn't mean the philosophy is wrong.
Many religions have very strict rules of conduct that people don't
realistically uphold, yet that hasn't stopped them.
You don't have to be a saint to try to be good.

### "Triage" ethics doesn't make sense
Part of the problem of poverty is due to overpopulation.
Some people (including me to an extent) think that feeding the poor
will just result in more hungry people: some Malthusian treatment
is required to stabilize the populations.
It is best not to help countries that have "no hope" of escaping
poverty because they have poor practices (like too high fertility)
that will make aid ineffective.

Yet upon closer examination this makes no sense.
Countries' populations tend to rise, but then as standards
of living increase they level off as women have fewer children.
Right now many poor countries are in this state of population growth,
which may level off.
If this is seriously a concern, aid can also include things like
contraceptives or education for women to help family planning.
As a bringer of aid you can do a lot to ensure that the aid is effective,
instead of just throwing it at the problem which may make it worse.

Additionally, affluent countries don't have so few resources
that they have to make tough choices like only supporting
a few countries.
Treating aid like triage isn't an accurate portrayal of the situation.

### We are ethically responsible for our individual carbon emissions
Emitting carbon doesn't break any clear moral rules,
and consequentialistly my individual emissions don't make a noticeable
difference on the world's climate, so it appears that nobody is at fault
for climate change?

This however is a very differential view of consequences.
A vivid example from the book is imagining a troop of 100 bandits
who each steal somebody's dinner in a village of 100 people,
causing them to go hungry for the evening.
This is clearly wrong.
Now imagine if, to avoid doing anything wrong,
each bandit just took 1/100 of everybody's dinner.
Each bandit didn't cause anybody to go hungry,
yet the consequences of both scenarios are the same,
and therefore from a consequentialist viewpoint the 2 actions are the same.
Essentially, we can all be responsible for collective actions
which result in bad consequences.
As a result we should reduce our carbon emissions.

### Nature is like priceless art and should not be considered economically
Classic economic discounting is an argument showing that the value
of exploiting and destroying nature now might be worth its economic
losses in the future.
But nature is to a degree irreplaceable: planting a new forest
is not the same as an old-growth forest;
extinct species cannot be replaced.
It is hard to estimate the value of nature in the future:
rarity of certain wilderness sites could make particular
places more valuable based on supply/demand.
Perhaps one day future generations will value nature
several orders of magnitude more than we do now.
But if we destroy it now, a lot of potential value is lost.

Consider my own example: a billionaire wants to buy the
Mona Lisa and destroy it.
Of course, the Mona Lisa brings joy to many people
who see it every year, but maybe the billionaire's money
could be used to give a small gift to all these people instead,
or invested for future public works that benefit everybody.
Maybe economically the offer will make sense.
Yet many people would intuitively reject such an offer,
since the money offered is naturally quite replaceable,
while the Mona Lisa isn't.
There is a chance that the calculations done now could be wrong.
In effect, it is priceless.

Nature can be viewed in the same way.

# Additional note on utilitarianism
The book introduced me to the idea that utilitarianism doesn't
need to involve constant calculations of one's actions,
but can instead by divided into an _intutive_ part
and a _critical_ part.

Utilitarianism can be used to devise general intuitive rules
(like _"killing/stealing/lying is wrong"_),
which can be followed without much thought,
and only used _critically_ in exceptional or abnormal circumstances.
This avoids some pitfalls of hedonistic utilitarianism
that I had encountered previously.
For example, a strictly utilitarian doctor might be
tempted to kill a patient and use their organs to save
5 other patients.
If the donor patient had no family and the murder would be secret,
there would be no negative consequences for others,
so a strictly utilitarian calculation might condone the murder.
But, if utilitarianism is simply used to create moral rules
which are followed intuitively, then the doctor is not
burdened by having to do this calculation,
and can instead simply choose not to murder without worrying
that it is unethical, while still being a utilitarian.
