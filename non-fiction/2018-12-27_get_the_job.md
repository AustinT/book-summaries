# Get the Job: Optimize Your Resume for the Online Job Search

This book was a good short summary of how to write a good resume.
I felt that I knew some of it, but it still gave me a lot of useful information.
Important points were:
- Resumes are just a tool used to get you the interview.
 Approach it like its an argument of why they should hire you,
 rather than a retelling of your life story.
- A lot of HR departments use resume databases with keyword matching to find candidates. If a new position opens up,
 they will input relevant keywords into their software to bring up the most relevant resumes.
 Therefore, the first screening your resume must pass through is the keyword search.
 Make sure to include a lot of keywords on your resume!
- Make sure the resume is nice to look at. Don't cram in too much content.
- The "2 page limit" isn't true, although maybe only the first 2 pages will be looked at.

It also includes guides on how to structure a resume to address career gaps, career changes, etc.
