# On Managing People

## Collection of essays from the Harvard Business Review

A collection of essays on management. Noteworthy takeaways on various topics:

- **Motivation**: people feel most motivated when they are ~50% sure that they
  can accomplish a goal. Motivation is less when the goal is too easy, and when
  it is too hard.
- **Expectations**: a manager's expectations are often realized by the
  employee. I the manager thinks highly of them, then they will try to rise to
  meet those expectations. The opposite is also true: if expectations are low,
  then performance may fall to reach the low expectations. It is very hard to
  counteract or fake this. The best managers tend to think of themselves as
  bringing out the best in their subordinates. The influence tends to be
  greater on younger employees, who unfortunately often have
  young/inexperienced managers.
- **Pay**: business owners often confuse labour costs with labour rates: the
  former is how much your business needs to pay for labour, and the latter is
  how much they pay the employees per hour. Often people will try to lower
  labour _costs_ by paying their employees less, which won't always be
  effective. For example, more skilled/highly-paid employees may do a job
  better and faster, resulting in an overall lower cost, even though their
  labour rate is higher.
- **Bonuses**: individual bonuses are not usually a good way to encourage
  performance, since it tends to make employees compete with each other in a
  way that doesn't help the business.
- **Alternative workplace**: this was a term for "working from home" in the
  1990s. Crazy to think that people were thinking about this even in the early
  days of the internet!
- **Setting up to fail**: a dynamic that can exist between a boss and employee
  where the employee performs badly, which the boss handles by
  watching/managing the employee more closely, which makes the employee feel
  discouraged/untrusted, causing them to perform even worse. They think things
  like "why bother when the boss will just make decisions for me anyway".
- **Persuasion**: the ingredients they give for persuasion are:
    - establishing credibility (e.g. past performance)
    - framing to find a common ground (start from the audience's current
      thoughts on an issue)
    - providing vivid evidence (can be facts and figures, although these are
      not always very persuasive)
    - connecting emotionally (very underrated)

Overall this was interesting to read, although a bit boring (it took me a long
time to finish).
