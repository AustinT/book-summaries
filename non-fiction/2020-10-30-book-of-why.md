# The Book of Why

## Judea Pearl

This book essentially tries to explain Judea Pearl's research into the
mathematics of causality over the past few decades. Causality is a super
interesting subject with enormous practical demand, and Judea Pearl is perhaps
_the_ expert in the field. Unfortunately, I felt that this book just sort of
danced around the subject and spent most of its time telling the story of how
exactly he came up with the core ideas. I finished it feeling only vaguely
aware of the techniques used to study causality rather than actually
understanding it. Perhaps this is just a consequence of me being a graduate
student studying a mathematical subject, but I was hoping for more. Overall
I would recommend just reading a summary of this book rather than investing the
time to read the whole thing.

I do however plan to read Judea Pearl's textbook on the subject which might be
more to my liking.
