# Gödel, Escher, Bach
## Finished ~ 2018-04-01
This was a very interesting book by Douglas Hofstadter. Essentially he dances around the works of the mathematician Gödel, the artist Escher, and the composer Bach, and touches on a variety of themes, from logic, to self-similarity, to artificial intelligence.
What I found most interesting was the extensive talk on self-similarity and self description. He essentially outlined a variety of ways in which a system can store information about itself (_meta-information_). This can occur in the brain, in DNA, and in math (as discovered by Gödel).
In the end, I think the book did what the author intended: it gave a nice explanation, with many examples, of how complex, self-referential behaviour can arise from a seemingly deterministic, unintelligent system.
Overall I would strongly recommend this book to anybody, but particularly to those interested in intelligence or the work of Gödel.
