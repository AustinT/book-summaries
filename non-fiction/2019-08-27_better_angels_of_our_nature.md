# The Better Angels of Our Nature
## Steven Pinker

Overall a fairly good book, in 1 sentence it argues that violence has declined overall,
going against the popular opinion that _the world is a more dangerous place now_
(although I don't really know anybody personally who argues that,
I always just thought it was the media trying to scare old people).
It was an interesting book, somewhere between a paper and a popular non-fiction book.
On one hand, it had figures, data, and talked a lot about statistics, but it had nowhere the same level of depth and objectivity that a scientific paper would have.

## Positive things I took away
1. Anecdotally, a lot of really "uncivilized" behaviour has declined over the past century.
 For example, the idea of "honour culture" has largely disappeared.
 I don't think that very many people will get into a fight because somebody randomly insults them;
 instead they might just laugh it off.
 I can see how people being less petty about small things can lead to less violence.
2. A lot of extremely violent practices have stopped, or are almost unfathomable today.
 For example, actually applying medieval torture would get a horrid reaction from most people,
 whereas hundreds of years ago people actually *liked* watching others get tortured.
3. I liked the analysis of the psychology of "evil", namely that people tend to moralize their actions,
 so that "evil" people really think they are the good guys.
 It is a much more reasonable theory than people just being bad.

## Criticisms
These criticisms largely come from reading criticisms of the book on Wikipedia.
1. Apparently the statistics in the book isn't good?
 [This article](https://www.fooledbyrandomness.com/pinker.pdf) argues that he shouldn't have used a Poisson distribution to look at the frequency of war,
 and instead use other special methods that are better for modelling rare events.
 I don't feel I know enough statistics to have a good opinion on it,
 but I do agree that the statistics in the book wasn't thorough,
 and differences in data recording/the organization of states makes using this data to make claims about the present a bit inaccurate I think.
 I think the statistics is really used more as proof by authority than a reasoned proof
 (since the book is clearly aimed at people who don't understand the statistics),
 and people will probably default to believing if a credible-seeming scientists presents them with a bunch of data and charts that they don't understand.
 I pretty much believed it without question too until I read the paper linked above.
 In fairness, I feel that Pinker does take the time to point out
 that his analysis is not simply _doing the stats and accepting
 what it tells him_ (because the data isn't good enough for this
 to be possible),
 but that he has a theory, tries to look at stats, and at the very
 least the stats don't seem to show the opposite trend
 (even though you might not be able to reject the null hypothesis).
 So he isn't going too far with his shaky stats.
2. It is clearly written for an American leftist and nobody else.
 There are so many references to specifically the American leftist  values and movements,
 it felt like the book's subtext was "being on the left puts
 you on the right side of history".
 I believe in most of the American leftist values,
 so it's not like I disagreed with this interpretation,
 but having so much praise in the book feels like pandering to me.
3. It's quite Eurocentric, which is understandable since it is written for an American audience.
 I did learn that the Chinese had some awful massacres though,
 so at least it didn't just pretend the rest of the world didn't
 exist.

## Interesting things
- Kohlbergâ€™s Stages of Moral Development: rates the development of
 people's morality as they get older,
 from doing things to avoid punishment all the way to acting
 on universal principles (which some people never get to).
- It gave a very _savage_ perspective on native people around the
 world by citing a bunch of data about how violent the societies
 of Aboriginals and non-state societies of the past and present.
 Although I am obviously aware of this view,
 and know that it was the norm in colonial times,
 this was the first book I read that argued for it.
 It definitely seems racist, but I could also believe
 that the idea of Aboriginals being non-violent and peaceful
 societies could be a reaction to their systemic mistreatment
 by the Europeans.
 I don't feel that I know enough about this to have an opinion
 one way or another; I just found it interesting that the book
 seemed to argue for the more _taboo_ side.
- Made me want to read Hobbes (about the Leviathan), and more Peter Singer.
- It reminded me a lot of the anime _Psycho Pass_,
 since people live in a largely non-violent society that effectively
 has a _Leviathan_ ruling over it.
 When violence does happen, people are so unfamiliar with it that
 they don't even know how to react.
 This would be the same thing today with public stoning/crucifixion
 in much of today's world:
 it's just so barbaric that I don't even know if people could
 properly react to it.
