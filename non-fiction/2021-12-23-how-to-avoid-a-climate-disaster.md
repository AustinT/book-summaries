# How to Avoid a Climate Disaster

## Bill Gates

This book is Bill Gates' attempt to summarize what he thinks we need to do to
avoid a climate disaster. The book largely follows the biggest sources of
emissions, and gives recommendations for reducing each source. Here is a rough
summary of the key points:

- Electricity: the electricity must be made green through some combination of
  nuclear + renewables. Energy storage is the biggest challenge and needs
  research funding.
- Making things: we need lots of research into how to make things in a way that
  emits less carbon, particularly cement and steel (which are huge emitters
  now).
- Food production: need to produce fertilizer more efficiently, produce less
  meat, and do research into modifying agricultural processes to cut emissions.
- Transportation: we are already close to electric cars being economically
  effective and efficient. Further R&D will help this.
- Heating/cooling: should install heat pumps, and ensure that government
  regulations help make buildings more efficient.
- Governments have a big role to play for regulation and stimulating R&D.

A lot of his recommendations are similar to recommendations which I've seen
elsewhere. That being said, the following opinions in the book stood out to me:

1. Fighting climate change cannot come before improving the living standards of
   poor people. For example, we should not prevent extremely poor countries
   from electrifying just because they cannot do that with capital-intensive
   renewables.
2. It seems unlikely that aviation can be done with renewable energy because
   fossil fuels are so energy dense. It also seems unlikely that we can simply
   give up flying as a society. This will probably be one of the few areas
   where we would keep using fossil fuels and rely on carbon capture.
3. Decarbonizing the economy before 2030 is impossible and we shouldn't make
   this our goal. If we focus too much on 2030 governments may be tempted to
   focus too much on short-term reductions in emissions (e.g. replacing coal
   with natural gas) rather than long-term net zero policies.

Overall I think this book is worth reading if you are concerned about climate
change.
