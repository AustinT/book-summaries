# The Bible: A Biography, by Karen Armstrong

This book gave a good and succinct explanation of the history of the Bible.
Essentially what I learned was the way people perceived and interpreted
the texts that made up the Bible has changed a lot over time,
and that the literal interpretation popular among 
religious fundamentalists is a fairly recent development.

It was also interesting to learn about the different interpretations
in Christianity and Judaism, given that the Bible and Torah are largely the same.
