# The Righteous Mind: Why Good People are Divided by Politics and Religion

## Jonathan Haidt

This book tries to explain, unsurprisingly, why good people are divided by
politics and religion. Its central thesis is that most people's political and
religious opinions are mainly just post-hoc rationalizations of their moral
intuitions, and statements of group identity that further one's interest. Of
course, this may sound strange, but that's exactly his point: these
justifications are so convincing that they also fool _you_! A central metaphor
he uses is that of the rider and the elephant: the elephant is like our
automatic processes (emotions, intuitive judgements, hunches), and the rider is
our conscious brain. The rider can steer the elephant somewhat, but ultimately
doesn't really control what the elephant does, instead acting primarily as its
spokesperson.

He argues that morality can be approximated as activating 6 intuitive "morality foundations":
1. care/harm
2. fairness/cheating
3. loyalty/betrayal
4. authority/subversion
5. sanctity/degradation
6. liberty/oppression

Leftists tend to react mainly to care/harm and liberty/oppression, whereas
rightists more often react to all 6 of these moral foundations. For example,
when athletes kneel during the national anthem in protest, leftists see it
mainly as fighting against oppression, and don't care about the subversion of
authority/disloyalty. Rightists however react more strongly to the
subversion/disloyalty because they intuitively value this. The same logic can
be applied to a lot of other issues that divide the left and right
(immigration, military intervention, welfare, etc).

Good aphorism from the book: *Morality binds and blinds*: it binds us together
by creating/strengthening a sense of group identity, and tends to blind us
towards the motivations of those who don't share our morality. I liked this
aphorism a lot.

Personally, what I got from the book was a good explanation of the conservative
mindset, which I had a lot of trouble empathizing with (especially as somebody
skeptical of authority and doesn't believe in sanctity). Overall I felt that
the main substance of the book was in the first 2 parts, but it's still worth
reading.
