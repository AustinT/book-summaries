# Five Times Faster

## By Simon Sharpe

To meet our climate change goals, we need to reduce carbon emissions _five
times faster_ than we currently are (hence the title). This book is partly
explaining why progress is so slow, and partly how to fix it. The book is
divided into three parts. I will try to note the main points, but I read the
book in two stints so I may not remember everything from the first 2 parts.

## Part 1: Science

**What is going wrong?**
- Academics are focused on answering interesting/novel questions, rather than
  estimating things of interest. An anecdote from the conference is two
  presentations: one on predicted warming in a particular city, and one on how
  warming will impact bird migration. Academics liked the second one better
  since it had new methodology and asked a new question, whereas the city study
  just applied existing methods to a new problem. But clearly the first study
  produced better insights for humanity, and would be considered more important
  by policy makers.
- Focus on making claims that are solidly backed up by evidence, rather than
  more speculative claims. E.g. saying "humans definitely caused at least 50%
  of observed climate change", instead of saying "humans probably caused all of
  climate change".
- Lack of studying of tail risks or tipping points
- Studying certain topics (e.g. extreme climate risks) makes it appear like
  countries are creating backup plans for what to do if they don't meet their
  emissions targets, therefore this doesn't get funding.
- In academia, "conservative" means not making bold claims (e.g. there might be
  a bad tipping point which causes +10 C of warming). However, in insurance
  "conservative" means _overstating_ risks and being overly cautious. More
  climate science probably needs an "insurance" mindset.
- Lack of interdisciplinary work: e.g. predicting effects of climate-induced
  conflicts requires climate and geopolitics expertise.

**How to fix it?** Basically wants scientists to make bolder claims.

## Part 2: Economics

**What is going wrong?**
- Economists have studied "equilibrium" models where you slightly perturb the
  economy and change nothing else. These models don't predict huge nonlinear
  effects in the economy (e.g. economies of scale), and therefore are not a
  good basis to make large policy decisions. It is effectively an overly-myopic
  view.
- Equilibrium economics also suggests that "do the minimum possible" is the
  best economic intervention. This does not account for the government's role
  in shifting the equilibrium points.
- He is very critical of a line of work which tries to calculate the "optimal"
  amount of response to climate change. Essentially, this is an equilibrium
  model and tries to estimate costs by averaging a huge range of estimates
  (e.g. crop yields are anywhere from +10% to -10%). This averaging leaves out
  tail risk, and leaves out the "unknown unknowns", thereby conveying a false
  sense of certainty.
- Under equilibrium, a carbon tax and "cap and trade" have the same effect. But
  this ignores the non-marginal effects. If one company reduces emissions, they
  use less of the cap and the market price of carbon decreases. However, with a
  carbon tax the marginal cost is constant, so everybody is incentivized.
- Equilibrium model suggests doing what is cheapest "in the moment", which may
  not be the same as what is cheapest in the long term. For example, in the
  short term it may be cheapest to switch from coal to natural gas, but in the
  longer term it would be more expensive as you then need to switch from gas to
  renewables. Maybe it is cheaper just to switch to renewables up front. By
  making short-term "cost-effective" decisions, it may actually be more
  expensive in the long run.

**How to fix it?** Stronger industrial policy to switch to new equilibriums
(e.g. tax coal), use carbon taxes instead of "cap and trade".

## Part 3: Diplomacy

**What is going wrong?**
- Countries are trying to make long-term, unanimous, and wide-ranging
  agreements. These things all make agreement harder, so we move to the lowest
  common denominator.
- We have slid into a toothless, "set your own targets" Paris agreement. It is
  like asking people to set their own tax rate, promising to pay more tax in
  the future.
- Paris was a gamble because it had no substance, but they hoped that it would
  send the signal that governments are serious and therefore push investors to
  put more money into renewables. However, this whole thing has not worked out.
- There is remarkably little coordination between ministers in different
  countries who might want to coordinate (e.g. transport ministers).


**How to fix it?**
- Smaller, sector specific agreements. E.g. agreements between all countries
  planning to build new coal power plants to not do it.
- Governments agreeing to make test markets: e.g. EU could agree to buy
  low-carbon steel at higher prices, to give it a foothold to scale, improve
  the technology and ultimately become cheaper.
- Easiest starting point now is probably electric cars

## Summary

Overall I thought this was a thoughtful and well-written book with many good
points. The key takeaway for me was that society seems to have allocated parts
of climate change to different specialists who address the problem is
_slightly_ the wrong way, because they don't have a good model of how their
work fits into the larger whole. There probably need to be more "climate
generalists" who have a big-picture view. Simon Sharpe seems like a good
candidate to be such a person.

Overall I think this is a good book to learn more about climate change!
