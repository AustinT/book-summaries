# Birth of a Theorem: a mathematical adventure

## Cédric Villani

An autobiography of Cédric Villani, who won the Fields Medal in 2010 for his
work on Landau damping. The book primarily focuses on his life in the period
from 2008-2011, when he made the discovery that earned him the Fields Medal.
The technical details are light (although there are a lot of theorem statements
and excerpts from the paper), and I didn't feel that I gleaned a lot of
actionable advice from reading this book. My main notes are:

- The theorem started with intuition, then a series of conjectures, which were
  slowly refined over time. Rather than a deduction from A to B, it seemed to
  proceed in a series of steps like "I feel like condition C must be true, or
  at least approximately true, so I will try to prove it or discover the
  necessary conditions for it to hold". These bits were eventually pieced
  together into a proper proof.
- He seemed very much helped by time pressure: several times he gave himself
  impossible-seeming deadlines and managed to pull out results by working late
  into the night. An example is scheduling a talk about a result that he had
  not yet proved. I don't think that I could survive using this method.
- Collaboration seemed to help: he worked closely with a collaborator in
  a different time zone, so that work could be done on the project almost 24/7.
  I imagine that this kind of collaboration could be useful.

Overall it was interesting to read, but I wouldn't recommend reading it looking
for success tips for research/graduate school.
