This was a very good book in my opinion, although some of the 80s references were lost on me. I think the picture of the future it paints might be accurate: an unhappy, divided population that can't get jobs, and only finds escape in VR. I hope governments plan ahead to avoid such a future. Also I feel like the lack of AI in the book was a bit surprising- I expect AI to play a much larger role in peoples' lives (both in VR and outside) than in the book, where they just had virtual assistants and stuff.

Overall would recommend.

Interesting book; made me want to learn about the I Ching (a Chinese divination book).
