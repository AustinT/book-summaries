# 2018-07-09: Ready Player One
This was a very good book in my opinion, although some of the 80s references were lost on me. I think the picture of the future it paints might be accurate: an unhappy, divided population that can't get jobs, and only finds escape in VR. I hope governments plan ahead to avoid such a future. Also I feel like the lack of AI in the book was a bit surprising- I expect AI to play a much larger role in peoples' lives (both in VR and outside) than in the book, where they just had virtual assistants and stuff.

Overall would recommend.

Interesting book; made me want to learn about the I Ching (a Chinese divination book).

# 2020-05-25 Angela's Ashes

Very sad but moving book. Made me realize how lucky I was in my childhood not
to grow up in poverty.

# 2020-07-01 The Handmaid's Tale

Very gripping novel. It definitely lived up to its fame.

# 2020-12-26 Remembrance of Earth's Past trilogy

Also known as "The Three-Body Problem" after the first book. This trilogy was
amazing: it really reminded me of the difficulties of international cooperation
and how human tendencies and values can get in the way of what's best for the
human race. I think this book raises a lot of interesting philosophical
questions in addition to being very well-written. I would definitely recommend
this trilogy!

# 2021-02-12 The Great Gatsby

An interesting book, but to me it didn't live up to my expectations given that
it is considered to be an American classic. The whole plot seemed a bit mundane
to me.
